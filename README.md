# *Iris* flower data set

> “if we are to learn anything about the ultimate nature of species we must reduce the problem to the simplest terms and study a few easily recognized, well differentiated species”

This famous dataset, known to be used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, *The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems*, includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) and has been one of the earliest datasets in Statistis and Computer Science as well as in the literature on classification methods.

## Objective

The purpose of this project will be to extract the data and analyse it by creating a program that:
> 
1. Extracts and organises the different flower types and their categories
2. Summarises each variable to a single text file that one can then use.
3. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables. 
4. Extracts a possible correlation between the various species.
